Number Guessing Game
This is a simple Java game where the computer tries to guess the number you're thinking of between 1 and 100 using binary search.

How to Play -->
1. Think of a number between 1 and 100 (but don't tell the computer!).

2. The computer will guess the number.

3. You tell it:
h â†’ if your number is higher
l â†’ if your number is lower
c â†’ if the guess is correct

4. It keeps guessing until it gets your number.

Example :

Is your number 50?
> h
Is your number 75?
> l
Is your number 62?
> c
Yay! I guessed your number: 62
